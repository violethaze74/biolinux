# This script is required because of CloudMan - CloudMan's path resolution
# code would result in using the latest version of PostgreSQL installed via
# a package manager. However, if a user switches images, the database data
# may not match the version of PostgreSQL being invoked so this script
# is used to differentiate which PostgreSQL version is actually invoked.
# This had to be done here because it was the only variable for old
# clusters being invoked with a new image. Also note that this script
# is image dependent (because PostgreSQL v9.1 will be the default version).
